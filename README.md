# ublueniri

Fedora bootc image created from Universal Blue's template.
https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template

## Switch to the Image

From your bootc system, run the following command.
```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/pliveyns/ublueniri
```
This should queue the image for the next reboot, which you can do immediately after the command finishes.
